Assignment Requirements: 

TRAINING THE NAÏVE BAYES CLASSIFIER FOR MOVIE REVIEW CLASSIFICATION
1. Implement in Python a Naïve Bayes classifier with bag-of-word features and add-1
smoothing. Note: Smoothing should be used for the context features (bag-of-word
features) only. Do not use smoothing for the prior parameters.


2. Use the following small corpus of movie reviews to train your classifier. Save the parameters
of your model in a file called movie-review.NB
a) fun, couple, love, love comedy
b) fast, furious, shoot action
c) couple, fly, fast, fun, fun comedy
d) furious, shoot, shoot, fun action
e) fly, fast, shoot, love action

3. Test you classifier on the new document below: {fast, couple, shoot, fly}. Compute the
most likely class. Report the probabilities for each class.
